 The owncloud package installs the codebase and makes it functional
 by installing platform specific dependencies.
 You can alternatively install only(!) owncloud-files, if you get errors here.
 Admins are advised to check for missing dependencies
 and configuration settings using owncloud online documentation and the occ tool.

 .
 At the same time, ownCloud provides employees and end users anywhere,
 anytime access to the files they need to get the job done - via mobile apps,
 desktop sync clients, WebDAV clients and the web. With ownCloud, employees
 can easily view and share documents and information critical to the
 business, in a secure, flexible and controlled architecture - one that is
 consistent with IT policies, procedures and regulatory requirements.
